Short term:
	* Add support for audio
	* Add support for IEEE1394 (Firewire) devices
	* Add support for streaming random video files from disk
	* Add support for saving streams to disk
	* i18n support

Long term:
	* Handle multiple devices in a graceful manner
		(Right now it blindly pokes /dev/video0)
	* Ability to switch off audio/video whenever required
	* Video effects (yay!!)
	* Logo (image) overlay support
	* Text overlay positioning support 
		(so that you can have text overlay on the center of
		the screen)
	* Documentation 
		(This should seriously go into the short term goals, 
		but I'm too lazy I guess)
