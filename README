What is Hippopotamus ?
======================

Hippopotamus is a simple GStreamer/GTK based application which lets you stream 
Ogg/Theora video to a IceCast server. In other words, it makes creating  video 
source for IceCast (2.x) very easy.
At present, it can only stream video data from v4l devices (webcames, etc) - but I 
plan to add support for audio within the next one or two releases. Hippopotamus was 
inspired by the screencasting software Istanbul, and copies heavily from it.

The name Hippopotamus
=====================

Well, I think I like hippopotami. My friend Sayan, however, thinks otherwise - and 
here's his explanation for the name:
Hippos -> Ancient Greek word for horse - signifying fast.
Potamos -> Ancient Greek word for river, or if you see it as we do, a stream.
So, the combination of Hippos and Potamos, ie, Hippopotamus stands for fast streamer.
OK - that was Sayan's explanation, and not mine - I'll simply stick to the fact that I 
have a fascination for hippopotami, and I like hippopotami.
